Questions:

what are we trying to predict? trying to do?

We want to figure out what tweakable variables are most
useful, and in what contexts.

are more features useful?
can we use the same feature for different predictions?


Tweaks on Jack's end:
  -- number of unique hostnames
  -- adding more variables in the input automaton dataset
  -- more to come


Tweaks on Ben's end:
  -- grammars
  -- oplist in gramamrs




Next Steps:

-- experiment with grammar a) stucture b) functions available
-- possibly implement feature application in R
-- 


Later Steps:


Social media data
Use unsupervised algorithms to classify datasets




Rules:
No Python
